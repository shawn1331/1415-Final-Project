    a. create CRC cards for classes
    b. Test functions implemented
    c. Write the test functions that fail one at a time
    d. Start writing code to make them pass one at a time

2. Get the board printing correctly blank/ then with pieces
    a. make a menu
    b. work on movement logic
    c. add in logic for jumps
    d. add in logic for multiple jumps

3. Work on final touches to get the base game running and functioning correctly
    a. Work on extra functionality if the base game is working by this time


4. Add in the extra functionality & any final touches
    a. Leaderboard
    b. Computer simulated AI (random movements)
    c. Checkerboard size options
    d. Color options for pieces (maybe)
    e. Color options for the board(maybe)
    f. Different markers for pieces(maybe)
    g. Themed board and pieces(maybe)

    i. 

5. Checkers rules
    a. 12 checkers per player on black squares only
    b. 3 rows of 4 checkers per row
    c. board is  8x8
    d. pieces can only move forward on black squares (diagonally) unless they are Kings then they can move backwards(diagonally)
    e. pieces become kings by making it to the last row of the opposite side of the board
    f.  the game is over when one player is out of checkers or when one player cannot make a legal move
    g.
